When we write code we want to ensure we have comments that inform the reader what each part of the code does. We write in-line comments throughout that explain each function and what it does within the class. Additionally, we use proper 
indentation, whitespace and meaningful names for variables and functions. Utilizing this for my CRUD python module allows it to be reusable and adaptable for other projects or other users. This CRUD python module could be used for 
different queries I may implement with MongoDB. 

As a computer scientist, I approach problems analytically as a way to understand my clients needs. Their needs need to be broken down into different components that I can work on solving. The requirements for Grazioso Salvare were first 
broken down as a class to create, read, update, and delete the contents they would be filtering from. The dashboard I created then used this class and was created with the intention a user could filter the animal shelter table to the state 
they desired. I don’t typically ask for help with my projects but I did this term. I’m thankful for the help I received and I will ask for it in the future as I need it. 

Computer scientists create and develop hardware and software with the intent to solve a clients needs or problem. This is important as computer scientists continuously create new software and hardware, solve problems and create solutions 
for any part of our lives. The solutions we create make it faster and easier for the client to obtain what they need. The work I did for Grazioso Salvare will help them find the specific dogs from different animal shelters they desired to 
train as rescue dogs. It will be much faster than calling every shelter to research which shelter has the dogs they need.
